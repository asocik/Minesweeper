# Minesweeper

This project implements the classic game Minesweeper using the Java Swing Library. This particular game is played on a 10x10 grid and contains 10 randomly placed mines. To play the game just import the files into Eclipse, or compile them on the command line, just make sure the images folder is in the working directory.
